## Pre-Deployment

1.  Identify the buoy (spar or pole) that you will deploy
2.  Prepare an array that will work for that buoy type
3.  Attach Sensus depth sensor to the top of the array with a zip tie
4.  Setup SoundTrap recorder to record at the following settings (see screenshot below) and attach to brace on the array
    -   Set time (UTC) to start recording an hour or more prior than the planned deployment time
    -   Select channels 1 & 2
    -   384kHz sample rate
    -   Check off ancillary sensors if available (log every 10s)
    -   Check disable calibration tones
    -   Click deploy

5.  A few hours prior to deployment, turn on the GPS and make sure it has a clear view of the sky.
    1.  Check that it is pinging consistently over a few hours
    2.  Make sure it is attached properly to the buoy
6.  Attach a strobe to the buoy using zip ties (see screen shot below)
7.  Pull out an anchor that is appropriate for the buoy you are using
8.  Note all equipment details in the [Deployment Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bxlwfVOe1LFfj69B_YddxcA0V14m7codYwgD2YncFk/edit?gid=395545420#gid=395545420) Google Sheet

## Deployment

1.  Ask the vessel captain to slow the boat to 2 kts (or whatever speed you need for bare steerage)
2.  Lay the buoy, array, and anchor on the back deck and attach all components to one another
3.  Set up a guideline for the anchor so that you can easily lower it into the water
4.  Communicate with the ship's captain when you are ready to deploy
5.  With the help of at least one other person, lower the buoy into the water first
6.  Pay out the 100m of line that is attached to the buoy and the array
7.  Lower the array into the water gently
8.  Lower the anchor into the water with the guideline
9.  Mark the lat/long and time (UTC) in a GPS
    -   Record this information in the Deployment Details Google Sheet
