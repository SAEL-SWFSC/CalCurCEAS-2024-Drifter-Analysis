### PAMGuard

Full bandwidth recordings were run through a suite of click detectors in [PAMguard](https://www.pamguard.org/) to pull out clicks corresponding to specific frequency bands. The recordings were first decimated to 288kHz. A 10kHz high pass filter was applied to the decimated recordings and then passed to the click detector. PAMguard settings files can be found [here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/tree/main/_data/BeakedWhales/Pamguard/PamgaurdSettings).

### Events (work in progress)

An experienced analyst (Anne Simonis) manually scanned the click data in PAMGuard Viewer Mode and created beaked whale events.

### *Status:*

*All data has been processed in PAMGuard. Manual event annotation on hold until contract awarded.*
