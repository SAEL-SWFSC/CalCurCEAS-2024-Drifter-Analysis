### PAMGuard - Detection Binaries & Databases

Full bandwidth recordings were run through a suite of click detectors in PAMGuard to pull out clicks corresponding to specific frequency bands. Each drifting acoustic recorder was run independently through PAMGuard. Click information was saved in binary files, while settings for the configuration were saved in a database.

-   PAMGuard settings files can be found [here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/tree/main/_data/SpermWhales/Pamguard/PamguardSettings).

-   Binaries and databases can be found locally on the DON here "Z:/ANALYSIS/CalCurCEAS_2024/Sperm_whales", and on the cloud here "pifsc-1-detector-output/drifting_recorder/1_Binaries-Database/2024_CalCurCEAS"

### PAMpal - Acoustic Studies

Following PAMGuard processing, [PAMpal](https://taikisan21.github.io/PAMpal/) was used to create acoustic studies for all detections in each drift. Using the binaries and databases from PAMGuard, the [CalCurCEAS_drift-specific_Pm.Rmd R code](Analysis/blob/main/_code/PM_analysis/CalCurCEAS_drift-specific_Pm.Rmd) was run for each drift, resulting in 4 .RData objects per drift.

-   Acoustic studies can be found locally on the DON here "Z:/ANALYSIS/CalCurCEAS_2024/Sperm_whales/AcousticStudies", and on the cloud here "pifsc-1-detector-output/drifting_recorder/2_Acoustic-Studies/2024_CalCurCEAS"

### Event Summaries

The next step was to create event summary reports for all potential sperm whale click events. The [SpermWhale_event_summary_report_drifter.rmd](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/blob/main/_code/PM_analysis/SpermWhale_event_summary_report_drifter.Rmd) and [run_report.R](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/blob/main/_code/PM_analysis/run_report.R) code were run to produce an HTML of each potential event and an event table.

Event summary reports can be found;

-   Locally on the DON [here](Z:\ANALYSIS\CalCurCEAS_2024\Sperm_whales\EventSummaries)

-   On the cloud [here](pifsc-1-detector-output/drifting_recorder/3_Event-Summaries/2024_CalCurCEAS)

-   On this GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/tree/main/_data/SpermWhales/EventSummaries)

### Manual Validation

Lastly, these events will be manually validated as sperm whale click events or noise, and those validated detections will be used for further analysis.

### *Status:*

*All data pre-processing has been completed and the event summaries are ready to be manually validated*
