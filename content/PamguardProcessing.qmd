# Summary

[Pamgaurd version 2.02.14](https://www.pamguard.org/releases/download.html) was used to process all drifting acoustic buoy recordings in order to collect click data for both sperm whales and beaked whales. Analysis of these data will differ on a species by species basis.

# Beaked Whales

Full bandwidth recordings were run through a suite of click detectors in [PAMguard](https://www.pamguard.org/) to pull out clicks corresponding to specific frequency bands. Prior to this, recordings were decimated to 288kHz. A 10kHz high pass filter was applied to the decimated recordings and then passed to the click detector. PAMguard settings files can be found [here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis/tree/main/data/BeakedWhales/Pamguard/PamgaurdSettings).

# Sperm Whales

In progress
