# Summary

[Pamgaurd version 2.02.14](https://www.pamguard.org/releases/download.html) was used to process all drifting acoustic buoy recordings in order to collect click data for both sperm whales and beaked whales. Analysis of these data will differ on a species by species basis.

# Beaked Whales

Full bandwith recordings were run through a suite of click detectors in Pamguard to pull out clicks corresponding to specific frequency bands.
