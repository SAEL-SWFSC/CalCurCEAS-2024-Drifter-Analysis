The survey was conducted over the course of 6 legs aboard the M/V Bold Horizon between July 24th and December 5th 2024. The primary objectives of CalCurCEAS 2024 was to collect visual sightings data for marine mammals and seabirds, passive acoustic data for cetaceans, biopsy tissue samples for cetaceans and environmental DNA samples. These datasets will be used for a suite of analyses that support MMTD‚Äôs fulfillment of regulatory requirements and scientific initiatives, such as marine mammal stock assessments for stakeholders such as the US Navy and BOEM."

Make sure that one person keeps an eye on the line as it is being pulled aboard so that it doesn‚Äôt chaff on the ship and so that you can see the subsurface gear as it approaches the surface.\nRemove line from the capstan once you see the drogue and hand pull the array onto the ship.\n\nHold the hydrophone array away from the vessel lip as you are retrieving it to avoid banging the array against the ship.\nLift the recorder and anchor carefully over the railing.\n\nMake note of the date, time, latitude and longitude upon retrieval."

The reason behind using both buoy types was to test how the PIFSC buoy fared in the California Current. Historically the radar reflectors on the pole buoys acted as sails, and caused the drift rate of that buoy to be faster than expected. Each buoy type used different GPS units for tracking and a different weighted anchor, although the rest of the sub-surface gear was the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pole buoy consists of an 8-12 ft aluminum pole that is weighted on one end. Crab floats are fastened to the center of the pole to keep it up right in the water. There is a radar reflector towards the top of the pole to aid in retrieval during days with poor visibility. At the very top of the pole is a mount for a SmarOne Solar GPS.\n\n\n\nThe PIFSC buoy is made up of PVC sealed spar as the main body and a clam shell floating collar that is bolted together at the top of the spar body. Inside the head piece is a 3D printed mount for 2 Spot GPS units and their corresponding battery packs."
