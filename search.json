    "text": "Overview\nThe 2024 California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (CalCurCEAS) was conducted by the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD) of NOAA Fisheries’ Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC). The survey was conducted over the course of 6 legs aboard the M/V Bold Horizon between July 24th and December 5th 2024. The primary objectives of CalCurCEAS 2024 was to collect visual sightings data for marine mammals and seabirds, passive acoustic data for cetaceans, biopsy tissue samples for cetaceans and environmental DNA samples. These datasets will be used for a suite of analyses that support MMTD’s fulfillment of regulatory requirements and scientific initiatives, including marine mammal stock assessments for stakeholders such as the US Navy and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).",

Buoys were deployed on all legs except for leg 1 due to it’s transitory nature (re-positioning the vessel from San Diego to the north end of the study area). Buoys were then left to drift at sea between 2-14 days before being retrieved.\nData from those buoys were downloaded and then processed to look for specific species.

    "text": "Driftwatch\nDriftWatch was developed by our team (Taiki Sakai) to help us track our buoys. Ocean currents can be unpredictable, so having a near-real-time tool to keep track of buoy positions is very useful. DriftWatch automatically downloads GPS data for each buoy, and creates plots of their drift tracks with the ocean currents every hour. These get uploaded to a Google Drive folder so that it is easy for anyone to access them.\nDriftwatch currently consists of 3 functions:\n\nDrift Maps. Maps of current deployments, updated hourly\nTest Deployments. Allows user to create a map of potential deployment locations overlaid on ocean currents\nText Location Updates. Sends text message updates on buoy location to aid retrieval.\n\n\nDrift Maps\nMaps will automatically be made for any deployments that DriftWatch knows about. To add a new deployment, you need to fill in information in the NEW DEPLOYMENT TO SAVE tab of the Deployment Details worksheet. The important fields for DriftWatch are:\n\nDeployment_Date_UTC - The date of deployment. This is when DriftWatch will start creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_Start_UTC - To be filled in later, the start of usable data on the recording. \nRecovery_Date_UTC - The date of recovery. This is when DriftWatch will stop creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_End_UTC - To be filled in later, the end of usable data on the recording. \nGPS ID - The ID(s) for the trackers attached to this deployment. Should be letters for SPOT devices, or SO-### for solar devices. If multiple trackers are used, they should be separated by a /\nProject - Project name, e.g ADRIFT\nDeploymentID - Deployment number for this project\nSite - Optional, a 3 letter code for the deployment site. Should be one of the options on the “Site List” tab of the worksheet\n\nOnce these are filled in, DriftWatch will add this drift to its known deployments the next time it runs, and maps will be made. The remainder of the fields are not used by DriftWatch, but should be filled in if you have the information.\nPlots are uploaded to the “DriftPlots” folder every hour, and are named according to the following naming scheme:\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Driftwatch output for HYCOM, HFRADAR and WCOFS models\n\n\nThe “Current” being displayed is from either Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), High Frequency Radar (HFRADAR), or West Coast Operational Forecast System (WCOFS) depending on which source of ocean current data is being used. DriftWatch will always try to make a plot using all three, but occasionally it can run into errors trying to download the data so you may only see one. HYCOM data have excellent coverage everywhere, but the major downside is that they are only updated once a day, typically in the morning. This means that the current picture may not look accurate later in the day. HFRADAR is updated much more frequently, but there are many areas that do not have any coverage for HFRADAR, so your plot may not show any data. Additionally, the HFRADAR data source has been much more finicky, and can often be unavailable for download. WCOFS provides predictions of the astronomical tide up to four times per day, but cannot predict current changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow. All plots show the last time the current data was updated at the bottom.",

    "text": "PAMGuard - Detection Binaries & Databases\nFull bandwidth recordings were run through a suite of click detectors in PAMGuard to pull out clicks corresponding to specific frequency bands. Each drifting acoustic recorder was run independently through PAMGuard. Click information was saved in binary files, while settings for the configuration were saved in a database.\n\nPAMGuard settings files can be found here.\nBinaries and databases can be found locally on the DON here “Z:/ANALYSIS/CalCurCEAS_2024/Sperm_whales”, and on the cloud here “pifsc-1-detector-output/drifting_recorder/1_Binaries-Database/2024_CalCurCEAS”\n\n\n\nPAMpal - Acoustic Studies\nFollowing PAMGuard processing, PAMpal was used to create acoustic studies for all detections in each drift. Using the binaries and databases from PAMGuard, the CalCurCEAS_drift-specific_Pm.Rmd R code was run for each drift, resulting in 4 .RData objects per drift.\n\nAcoustic studies can be found locally on the DON here “Z:/ANALYSIS/CalCurCEAS_2024/Sperm_whales/AcousticStudies”, and on the cloud here “pifsc-1-detector-output/drifting_recorder/2_Acoustic-Studies/2024_CalCurCEAS”\n\n\n\nEvent Summaries\nThe next step was to create event summary reports for all potential sperm whale click events. The SpermWhale_event_summary_report_drifter.rmd and run_report.R code were run to produce an HTML of each potential event and an event table.\nEvent summary reports can be found;\n\nLocally on the DON here\nOn the cloud here\nOn this GitHub repo here\n\n\n\n\nSperm whale event summary report\n\n\n\n\nManual Validation\nThese events were manually validated (Jenny Trickey, PIFSC) using a Triton-based approach similar to methods used during the Adrift project, except without decimation. This manual analysis provides a list of wav files that contain sperm whales.\nSummary reports (above) were unhelpful for unvalidated sperm whale events (the relatively generic spectral features of sperm whales made filtering the large numbers of false positives very difficult). The summary reports may be helpful if run post-classification and validation.\nLinks to datasets can be found on this github repository (SpermWhale_DASBR, CalCurCEAS data locations readme).\n\n\nStatus:\nAll data have been manually validated and will be analyzed by the SPACIOUS team for use in developing a statistical approach for population assessment using slowly moving PAM platforms (including drifting acoustic recorders).",

It should be stated that the whistle and moan and the cepstrum detectors were also run on the data, although those output are not currently being used for this analysis. Analysis of these data will differ on a species by species basis."

If using a different surface buoy, the reflective SOLAS tape can be seen at ranges up to 0.5 nmi. Use a spotlight to illuminate the reflective tape.\nUsing a boat hook or grapple to grab the orange floating line between the main buoy and the trailing buoy.\nBring the buoy on board and set it on deck\nRetrieve the main line down to the subsurface gear and gently wrap it around the power capstan to pull in. Make sure that one person keeps an eye on the line as it is being pulled aboard so that it doesn’t chaff on the ship and so that you can see the subsurface gear as it approaches the surface.\nRemove line from the capstan once you see the drogue and hand pull the array onto the ship.\n\nHold the hydrophone array away from the vessel lip as you are retrieving it to avoid banging the array against the ship.\nLift the recorder and anchor carefully over the railing.\n\nMake note of the date, time, latitude and longitude upon retrieval.",
