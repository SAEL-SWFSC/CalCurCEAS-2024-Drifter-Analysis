    "text": "Overview\nThe 2024 California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (CalCurCEAS) was conducted by the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD) of Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC). The survey was conducted over the course of 6 legs aboard the M/V Bold Horizon between July 24th and December 5th 2024. The primary objectives of CalCurCEAS 2024 was to collect visual sightings data for marine mammals and seabirds, passive acoustic data for cetaceans, biopsy tissue samples for cetaceans and environmental DNA samples. These datasets will be used for a suite of analyses that support MMTD’s fulfillment of regulatory requirements and scientific initiatives, such as marine mammal stock assessments for stakeholders such as the US Navy and BOEM.",

    "text": "Drifting Acoustic Recorders in the California Current\nThe passive acoustics component of CalCurCEAS 2024 was comprised of deploying drifting acoustic recording buoys at predetermined locations in the survey area. Buoys were deployed on all legs except for leg 1 due to it’s transitory nature (re-positioning the vessel from San Diego to the north end of the study area). Buoys were then left to drift at sea between 2-14 days before being retrieved.\nData from those buoys were downloaded and then processed to look for specific species. More detail can be found on the following pages.",

    "section": "Driftwatch",
    "text": "Driftwatch\nDriftWatch was developed by our team (Taiki Sakai) to help us track our buoys. Ocean currents can be unpredictable, so having a near-real-time tool to keep track of buoy positions is very useful. DriftWatch automatically downloads GPS data for each buoy, and creates plots of their drift tracks with the ocean currents every hour. These get uploaded to a Google Drive folder so that it is easy for anyone to access them.\nDriftwatch currently consists of 3 functions:\n\nDrift Maps. Maps of current deployments, updated hourly\nTest Deployments. Allows user to create a map of potential deployment locations overlaid on ocean currents\nText Location Updates. Sends text message updates on buoy location to aid retrieval.\n\n\nDrift Maps\nMaps will automatically be made for any deployments that DriftWatch knows about. To add a new deployment, you need to fill in information in the NEW DEPLOYMENT TO SAVE tab of the Deployment Details worksheet. The important fields for DriftWatch are:\n\nDeployment_Date_UTC - The date of deployment. This is when DriftWatch will start creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_Start_UTC - To be filled in later, the start of usable data on the recording. \nRecovery_Date_UTC - The date of recovery. This is when DriftWatch will stop creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_End_UTC - To be filled in later, the end of usable data on the recording. \nGPS ID - The ID(s) for the trackers attached to this deployment. Should be letters for SPOT devices, or SO-### for solar devices. If multiple trackers are used, they should be separated by a /\nProject - Project name, e.g ADRIFT\nDeploymentID - Deployment number for this project\nSite - Optional, a 3 letter code for the deployment site. Should be one of the options on the “Site List” tab of the worksheet\n\nOnce these are filled in, DriftWatch will add this drift to its known deployments the next time it runs, and maps will be made. The remainder of the fields are not used by DriftWatch, but should be filled in if you have the information.\nPlots are uploaded to the “DriftPlots” folder every hour, and are named according to the following naming scheme:\n\nProject_DeploymentID_Current_DeployDate_Site.png\n\n“Current” is either HYCOM or HFRADAR depending on which source of ocean current data is being used. DriftWatch will always try to make a plot using both, but occasionally it can run into errors trying to download the data so you may only see one. HYCOM data have excellent coverage everywhere, but the major downside is that they are only updated once a day, typically in the morning. This means that the current picture may not look accurate later in the day. HFRADAR is updated much more frequently, but there are many areas that do not have any coverage for HFRADAR, so your plot may not show any data. Additionally, the HFRADAR data source has been much more finicky, and can often be unavailable for download. All plots show the last time the current data was updated at the bottom.",
